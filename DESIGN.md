The Amazing Adventures of Freelancer Epic and Agent Topspeed
============================================================


## Story outline

Freelancer Epic is a action-oriented mercenary, always willing to fight for whoever offers the most money or biggest explosions, which is usually Operation Awesome.
Agent Topspeed is the best agent in Operation Awesome, dedicated to performing his duties ruthlessly and with style.
They must join their skills and styles in an effort to fight back against Stigma, the evil alien from Alpha Centauri, while the execs from Global Media watch on, hoping for some juicy footage to display during prime-time television.


## Base gameplay

Two-player horizontal bullet-hell shooter, with plenty of enemies, diverse environments, gigantic bosses and pounding retrelectronic rock music. Levels are scripted, set to music and short in order to encourage learning, but astoundingly difficult. Several mechanics exist in order to encourage team-play, increase survivability, and provide a die-and-retry flow.

A scoring system exists to encourage players to replay levels and compete on a global scoreboard, or organise tournaments.

A upgrade system exists in order to vary gameplay styles, for example switching out the bubble shield in exchange for a triple deflector, which can take several hits, but isn't as reliable.


## Play cycle

Each level starts with a short briefing in comic-book style, where the characters exchange some banter, the setting is revealed and the mission is described.
A battle against numerous enemies follows, each level focuses on a particular challenge, some levels may feature many weak craft firing a hail of bullets, while others might pit the players against tougher ram-attack vehicles. Upon death of both players, a "Retry?" prompt appears and the battle restarts from the beginning.
The battles are about one to three minutes long, but might require upwards of fifteen to twenty minutes to succeed.
Once the battle is done, a boss fight begins, bosses are composed of various stages which require learning to overcome. Dying during a boss fight prompts a "Retry?" which restarts the boss fight.
At this point, the players are presented with their score. Bonuses are awarded for succeeding the level without dying, killing more than a given percentage of enemies, or completing the boss under a given time.
Points can be spent to unlock upgrades, which are then used during the next level.


## Arcade modes

Arcade modes are included to encourage competitive play, focus is taken off of the story, and the infinite retry is removed, in order to encourage switching places with observers and organising a tournament style of play.

In the arcade modes, a certain number of "points" are given for the players to unlock the upgrades they wish to use, so that the upgrades of story mode remain available.

+ In survival mode, the level is procedurally populated, and becomes progressively more difficult, until the players are destroyed and a score is awarded.
+ In assault mode, the players have a given number of retries, and attempt the highest score on a given level.
